## How did you come up with your name?

I wanted to make a short simple name that would be easy for people to remember. I wanted to include what my account was about and something to do with my name. So I sat down at my desk and wrote out as many names that I could think of, I actually did this in my *colour me creative* book by *Kristina Webb* on one of the challenge pages. Then I narrowed it down to a few and chose my favourite. I like short and simple, and I’m so grateful that I chose a short, easy to remember name because now that my page is a business page with commissions, when people mention that I did a commission for them, it’s easy for them to connect *art_en* to *my name*. That’s just my opinion though, there are many people with longer names out there and they’re doing really well business-wise. So with names, in the end there’s no right or wrong.

## What are your top 3 favourite art supplies
My top three favourite art supplies would have to be:
- prismacolor premier pencils
- strathmore toned tan paper
- pan pastels

Prismacolor pencils are very vibrant and easy to blend which is useful especially for colouring skin. I haven’t tried many other pencil brands but I will do so in the future.
Strathmore toned tan paper is amazing to draw on, right now it is my go-to paper for drawing on. It is smooth and the colours it comes in are great.
Pan pastels are incredibly easy to use and are perfect for a base layer on a portrait. I have the portrait set and the only bad thing about it is that there are no very dark colours, although these can be bought separately.

I used all three of these products for a drawing and here is the product.
